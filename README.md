## üìö Development with AI

This game was developed with the challenge that at least 80% of the code must be written by AI. The entire development process is documented in the book [**"Vibe Coding: FPS Game Development Journey"**](https://wikidocs.net/book/17562) (in Korean).

The development process explored:
- Working with multiple AI models (Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini)
- Iterative refinement of AI-generated code
- Solving unique challenges in browser-based games
- Creating immersive gameplay and audio experiences

## üìñ Development Background

This project was created as an exploration of AI-assisted game development, with the following goals:
- Create a fully playable web-based FPS game
- Ensure at least 80% of code is AI-generated
- Implement instant play without loading screens
- Support both desktop and mobile devices
- Make the game free to play without signup requirements
