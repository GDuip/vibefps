# Technical Debt Tracker

This document tracks technical debt in the project, prioritizing items that need attention.

## High Priority (Must Address Before Submission)

| Issue | Description | Modules Affected | Estimated Effort | Priority |
|-------|-------------|------------------|------------------|----------|
| Event system completion | Complete the migration to event-based architecture | All modules | 2 days | HIGH |
| Mobile performance | Optimize rendering and physics for mobile devices | Graphics, Physics | 1 day | HIGH |
| Cross-browser compatibility | Fix issues in Firefox and Safari | All | 1 day | HIGH |

## Medium Priority (Should Address If Time Permits)

| Issue | Description | Modules Affected | Estimated Effort | Priority |
|-------|-------------|------------------|------------------|----------|
| Code duplication | Remove duplicate logic across versions | All modules | 0.5 days | MEDIUM |
| Error handling | Improve error handling and graceful fallbacks | All modules | 0.5 days | MEDIUM |
| Touch controls | Refine touch controls for better mobile experience | InputManager | 0.5 days | MEDIUM |

## Low Priority (Post-Competition Improvements)

| Issue | Description | Modules Affected | Estimated Effort | Priority |
|-------|-------------|------------------|------------------|----------|
| Module loader | Implement proper module loading system | All | 2 days | LOW |
| Unit tests | Add automated tests for core functions | All | 3 days | LOW |
| Code comments | Improve inline documentation | All | 1 day | LOW |

## Architectural Debt

| Issue | Description | Impact | Proposed Solution |
|-------|-------------|--------|-------------------|
| Direct module references | Some modules directly reference others instead of using events | Makes changes more difficult, tight coupling | Complete event system migration |
| Global state | Game state is accessed globally | Makes testing difficult, potential bugs | Encapsulate state management |
| Version management | Multiple versions with duplicated code | Maintenance overhead | Refactor to single codebase with version configuration |

## Refactoring Opportunities

| Component | Issue | Benefit of Refactoring | Approach |
|-----------|-------|------------------------|----------|
| InputManager | Handles both desktop and mobile input in monolithic functions | Clearer code, easier maintenance | Split into InputManagerDesktop and InputManagerMobile classes |
| TargetManager | Mixed concerns of rendering and game logic | Better separation of concerns | Split into TargetManager and TargetRenderer |
| Game.js | Too many responsibilities | Easier maintenance, testing | Extract TimerManager, ScoreManager, etc. |
