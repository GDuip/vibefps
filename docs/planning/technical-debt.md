# Technical Debt Tracker

This document tracks technical debt in the project, prioritizing items that need attention.

## High Priority (Must Address Before Submission)

| Issue | Description | Modules Affected | Estimated Effort | Priority |
|-------|-------------|------------------|------------------|----------|
| Event system completion | Complete remaining modules migration to event-based architecture | Graphics, Environment | 1 day | HIGH |
| Cross-browser compatibility | Fix issues in Firefox and Safari | All | 1 day | HIGH |
| Settings menu device optimization | Ensure settings work properly on all supported devices | GameSettings, UI | 0.5 days | HIGH |

## Medium Priority (Should Address If Time Permits)

| Issue | Description | Modules Affected | Estimated Effort | Priority |
|-------|-------------|------------------|------------------|----------|
| Code duplication | Remove duplicate logic across versions | All modules | 0.5 days | MEDIUM |
| Error handling | Improve error handling and graceful fallbacks | All modules | 0.5 days | MEDIUM |
| Mobile audio optimization | Optimize spatial audio for mobile devices | SpatialAudioSystem, AudioManager | 0.5 days | MEDIUM |
| Performance profiling | Identify and address performance bottlenecks | All modules | 1 day | MEDIUM |

## Low Priority (Post-Competition Improvements)

| Issue | Description | Modules Affected | Estimated Effort | Priority |
|-------|-------------|------------------|------------------|----------|
| Module loader | Implement proper module loading system | All | 2 days | LOW |
| Unit tests | Add automated tests for core functions | All | 3 days | LOW |
| Code comments | Improve inline documentation | All | 1 day | LOW |
| Audio presets | Add presets for different environment types | SpatialAudioSystem | 1 day | LOW |

## Architectural Debt

| Issue | Description | Impact | Proposed Solution |
|-------|-------------|--------|-------------------|
| Partial event system integration | Some modules use events while others still use direct references | Inconsistent architecture, harder to maintain | Complete event system migration for all modules |
| Global state | Game state is accessed globally | Makes testing difficult, potential bugs | Encapsulate state management |
| Version management | Multiple versions with duplicated code | Maintenance overhead | Refactor to single codebase with version configuration |
| Audio system complexity | Two parallel spatial audio implementations | Maintenance complexity, code duplication | Consolidate into single unified system |

## Refactoring Opportunities

| Component | Issue | Benefit of Refactoring | Approach |
|-----------|-------|------------------------|----------|
| InputManager | Handles both desktop and mobile input in monolithic functions | Clearer code, easier maintenance | Split into InputManagerDesktop and InputManagerMobile classes |
| TargetManager | Mixed concerns of rendering and game logic | Better separation of concerns | Split into TargetManager and TargetRenderer |
| Game.js | Too many responsibilities | Easier maintenance, testing | Extract TimerManager, ScoreManager, etc. |
| SpatialAudioSystem | Complex with multiple audio calculation methods | Better performance, easier maintenance | Refactor to strategy pattern for different quality levels |
