# Code Integration Checklist

## Before Implementation

- [ ] Does the code follow the module pattern used throughout the project?
- [ ] Are dependencies clearly identified?
- [ ] Is the code properly using the event system when appropriate?
- [ ] Does the code handle both desktop and mobile scenarios?

## Documentation

- [ ] Are all public methods and properties documented?
- [ ] Are event emissions and subscriptions documented?
- [ ] Are any complex algorithms or patterns explained?

## Implementation Quality

- [ ] Is error handling implemented for edge cases?
- [ ] Are there any potential memory leaks (especially with event listeners)?
- [ ] Does the code use appropriate performance optimizations?
- [ ] Is the code properly using consistent naming conventions?

## Integration Points

- [ ] Does the code properly integrate with affected modules?
- [ ] Are all required events being emitted with correct data?
- [ ] Are event subscriptions set up and properly managed?
- [ ] Do any circular dependencies exist that might cause issues?

## Testing Approach

- [ ] What manual tests should be performed to verify functionality?
- [ ] Are there any specific edge cases to test?
- [ ] Does the code need to be tested on mobile devices?
- [ ] Are there any performance concerns to benchmark?

## Final Validation

- [ ] Has the code been tested in the full game context?
- [ ] Do all features meet the requirements specified in the request?
- [ ] Is there any cleanup needed (console.logs, commented code, etc.)?
